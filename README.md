# txtLab : Research on Wikipedia

## General
This is a repository for scripts written to collect data on wikipedia articles and lists with the intent of understanding
how language is fought over on Wikipedia. Research is based in collecting lists of articles compiled 
by Wikipedia editors or categories on America novels, TV shows, and films and compiling revisions to individual 
articles included in those lists over time.

The project is being conducted for the McGill [txtLab](https://txtlab.org/).

## This repository
This repository contains the code used to collect and analyze a set of articles as part of a project for the txtLab. Using [wikipedia-histories](https://github.com/ndrezn/wikipedia-histories), a module to scrape article revisions, social network representations of editor relationships were created to represent the ways editors cross over between domains.

I'll eventually add the network and metadata functionality to `wikipedia-histories`.
